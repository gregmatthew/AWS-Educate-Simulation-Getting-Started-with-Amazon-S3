AWS S3 Static Website Simulation: Step-by-step guide to bucket creation, permissions, versioning, and presigned URL usage for hosting secure, scalable static sites

üöÄ Getting Started with Amazon S3: Static Website Simulation
This simulation walks you through the process of setting up a static website using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). You'll configure the service, upload content, manage permissions, and secure access to your data.

üß† Objectives
By the end of this simulation, you will be able to:

Create an S3 bucket

Configure static website hosting

Upload website content

Enable public access

Share objects securely with presigned URLs

Apply a bucket policy to protect content

Update website files

View object versions
